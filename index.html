<h1>My First Web Visualization</h1> 
<p>This is an interactive visual of the Life Expectancy given the GDP per capita of the continents in the world in 2007. I created it using this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-plotly-visualization-and-embed-it-on-websites-517c1a78568b">tutorial</a>. </p>

<p>The chart shows that life expectancy is an increasing function of GDP per capita. The colors of the circles represent the continents while the size is the population. GDP per capita is one of the many measures to judge the well-being of an economy and is the total income of a country normalized by its population, while the life expectancy is measured in number of years a person lives in a country. </p>  
<p>By clicking on the figure, a page opens to the interactive diagram which shows that Japan has the highest life expectancy while the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has the lowest. This is expected since an average personâ€™s makes 30,000 local currency units (LCU) more in Japan compared to DRC.  </p> 
    
<p>This is the online database of GDP per capita and Life Expectancy for all continents, weighted by the population, in 2007. </p>
